# Slido Calendars - Event Planning App
### Hello!

I've created this app as requested, there are some things that I need to address right away:
* The main app file is in example/src/app.js location. The file that I've been working on the most is timelineCalendar.js.
* There is "add event" functionality as well as going back to "today", colorful events, clear and visible event info and more.
* Default view is set as week view, but you can expand the calendar by swiping down.
* To use - please clone this repository and run `npm i` in the project directory. Build the project with Android studio and run!


Here is a preview of how the app works!
