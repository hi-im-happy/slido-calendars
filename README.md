# Slido Calendars - Event Planning App
### Hello!

I've created this app as requested, there are some things that I need to address right away: </br>
1. The main app file is in example/src/app.js location. The file that I've been working on the most is timelineCalendar.js <br>
2. There is "add event" functionality as well as going back to "today", colorful events, clear and visible event info and more
3.
