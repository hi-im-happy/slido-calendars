# Slido Calendars - Event Planning App
### Hello!

I've created this app as requested, there are some things that I need to address right away:
1. The main app file is in example/src/app.js location. The file that I've been working on the most is timelineCalendar.js.
2. There is "add event" functionality as well as going back to "today", colorful events, clear and visible event info and more.
3. Default view is set as week view, but you can expand the calendar by swiping down.
4. To use - please clone this repository and run ```npm i```. Build the project with Android studio.

Here is a preview of how the app works!
